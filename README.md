## What is RunCat?

RunCat is a unique and playful utility for macOS that places an animated character in your menu bar. The character’s animation speed varies in real-time based on your computer’s CPU usage. This offers an engaging and intuitive way to keep an eye on system performance without interrupting your workflow.

The application is incredibly lightweight and runs silently in the background. It supports a variety of characters including cats, dogs, rabbits, and even dinosaurs. Each character features smooth animations that respond dynamically to CPU load. RunCat is perfect for users who want a simple, visual indicator of how hard their Mac is working.

In addition to its visual appeal, RunCat is highly efficient and compatible with all modern versions of macOS, including Big Sur, Monterey, Ventura, and Sonoma. It works flawlessly on both Intel-based Macs and newer models with M1, M2, and M3 chips. The app is open-source and free to use, making it accessible to everyone.

With its minimalist design and fun concept, RunCat transforms mundane system monitoring into an enjoyable experience. It’s ideal for developers, designers, students, and anyone who wants a bit of personality in their menu bar.
